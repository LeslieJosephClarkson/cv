<h4><em>Mission Statement</em></h4>
<p>Ephratah Home advocates and promotes client choice, independence, and well being, in a
healthy, supportive, and culturally sensitive environment.</p>
<hr>
<h4><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h4>
<p>Ephratah Home is a staff operated 24 Hour residential facility for adults with intellectual
disabilities. The facility is designed to serve four (4) adults males between the ages 18 and 59
who are ambulatory. </p>
<p>Ephratah Home provides services to people who need support with activities of daily living,
acquisition/assistance with self-help skills and medications, and support with physical
challenges in coordination and/or mobility.</p>
<p>The mission of Ephratah Home is to advocate and promote client choices, independence, and
well being in a healthy, supportive, and culturally sensitive environment.</p>
<p>Ephratah Home understands that proper nutrition and exercise are important for long-term
health, specifically in areas such as diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity,
heart problems, bowel habits. Via proper nutrition (see menus attachment) and the
encouragement of exercise, Ephratah Home will try to enhance the overall health and well-being
of our clients.</p>
<p>Ephratah Home will provide support to help prevent acute illness and decompensation in order
to avoid people having to seek a more restrictive level of care. Ephratah Home is committed to
providing an environment that is rich in social stimulation, recreational activities, and opportunity
to pursue hobbies, interests and vocational pursuits. Age or disability, unusual behavior,
physical limitations and self-help deficits should not prevent individuals from participating fully in
community, family and social life. </p>
<hr>
<h4><em>Normalization</em></h4>
<p>Services at Ephratah Home are based on the principle of Normalization. This principle holds
that “Life conditions should enable clients to lead more Independent, Productive and Normal
Lives which approximate the Pattern of Daily Living of non-disabled persons of the Same Age
and reflect Personal Choices.”</p>
<p>In addition to the principle of normalization, services are provided using a Person-CenteredPlanning (PCP) process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of, and working toward, the preferred future of an individual </li>
  <li>The individual is at the center of the process</li>
  <li>Need to find out the individual’s strengths/weaknesses/preferences/barriers</li>
  <li>The individual chooses where & with whom to live, relationships, how to spend time
(work/education/leisure), activities</li>
<li>Choices should be exercised in a least-restrictive, culturally-sensitive, environment</li>
<li>During the planning process we EMPOWER the client by giving all necessary
information/options so that he/she can make informed decisions</li>
</ul>
